            "Shampoo.  I came flying from the king's palace.  But now I'll have to make some arrangements to stay somewhere.  No. I won't stay at a human's house.  I'll go to the forest.  I'll find some solution there.  Oh no. It's evening.  I'll have to find a tree as soon as possible.  Let's go.  There's a tree.  And it seems quite empty.  I'll go and sit on it.  Wow. I've found a made up nest here.  Good. I'll go to sleep now.  I'm a small and sweet bird.  My name is a small bird.  I'm a small and sweet bird.  Wow. It's morning.  This voice seems to be of a bird.  I think a small bird has come.  I'll have to eat it tonight.  I'll go and arrange some food now.  I'll decorate this nest properly when I return.  Wow. It's easy to get food in this village.  I think I've come to a very nice village.  Small bird, what's your name?  I've never seen you here before.  Mr. crow, my name is Tuni.  I came here yesterday.  Where did you stay before this?  And where did you make a nest?  I used to stay in Raja Kaka Buka's garden before this.  I made my nest on that big tree at the beginning of the forest.  What did you say?  A big tree at the beginning of the forest.  Is there a big tunnel under that tree?  I'm sure no other bird lives on that tree.  You're right.  But why don't other birds live there?  I don't know. But earlier...  Earlier what?  No. No. Forget it. You'll get scared.  Mr. crow, you've already scared me a lot.  Now tell me the whole story.  Earlier a lot of birds used to live on that tree.  But gradually the number of birds decreased.  No one knew where everyone was disappearing.  Everyone used to say that there's a ghost on that tree..  ..who was taking away all the birds.  Gradually the entire tree became empty.  And no one was left.  Oh! So that's the case.  I was wondering why there's no one else on that big tree.  Okay. I'll leave for today.  I'll see. I'll leave that tree and go somewhere else tomorrow.  Be careful, dear bird.  I'm scared to hear what Mr. crow said.  How will I stay alone?  But I'll somehow manage to get out of here tonight.  Wow! I think it's evening now.  I'll go and eat that bird.  No. I'm feeling very nervous.  Okay. I'll think of something.  Okay. I'll turn the tree from all sides and see.  Oh God! What's that?  It's going towards my nest.  Oh God! It's a snake.  Threat alert!  The enemy is approaching the tree.  He'll have this fish in his hands.  My폽f'smastic pike will stop you no matter where you stand.  That's why you should catch him.  I'm getting scared.  Wait. I'm going to two the tree.  Threat alert.  The enemy is approaching the tree.  He'll have this fish in his hands.  He'll have this fish in his hands.  The enemy is approaching the tree.  The little bird is going to the brinjal tree again and again.  What does she want to do?  Let me go and see what the matter is.  Oh! I see.  This is the matter.  The little bird has made a nest on the brinjal tree.  And it looks like she is going to lay eggs.  Very good. Lay eggs quickly.  So that I can taste the kids quickly.  I haven't eaten non-vegetarian food for a long time.  I will eat these kids with spices and chillies.  I am feeling very hungry.  My stomach is full of water.  Oh! I can't do it anymore.  I think I will have to lay eggs now.  I am also having trouble in flying.  Come on. Let me sit in the nest.  The little bird is sitting in the nest.  She is not even moving from there.  As far as I can guess..  ..it means that she has laid eggs.  I am feeling very happy thinking about it.  Round eggs.  The kids will come out of the eggs.  And I will eat the kids.  Raw kids.  No. I will eat them with spices and chillies.  Once the little bird leaves the nest..  ..then I won't be able to lay eggs.  Now that I have laid eggs..  ..I am not able to fly anymore.  I just have to sit on the eggs and keep them warm.  But I have been noticing for a few days..  ..that this cat is keeping an eye on me and my nest.  I hope she doesn't have any doubts.  Who knows?  Anyway cats have sharp eyes.  She must know that I have laid eggs.  Why is this little bird staring at me?  I hope she doesn't have any doubts on me..  ..that I want to eat her kids.  This little bird is very clever.  Just by looking at her face I can tell that she is very clever.  No. No.  I won't lay eggs on her nest anymore.  Otherwise she will have complete doubts on me.  Wow! My little kids are so beautiful.  But I will have to feed them.  But where do I feed them?  Keep quiet, my kids. Keep quiet.  No. I think I will have to go and find food.  I have got kids.  I am so happy that I don't know what to say.  I will catch each and every kid and eat them.  But I am scared of that cat.  I am just waiting for the time when that devil will eat my kids.  What do I do now?  I will have to go and get food for the kids.  I can do one thing.  When this cat will be busy eating..  ..I will go and find food.  Yes. That will be fine.  Keep quiet. Keep quiet, kids.  I am getting food. I am getting food.  Just wait for some time, my dear kids.  Yes. Give me milk again.  What else can you beggars give me?  This is what you are worth.  Just give me milk. What else can you do?  I will just drink milk.  It's good that the cat has got food.  This is my chance to go and find food quickly.  I think I saw something flying.  I think Toony has left.  Let me go and check if she has really left.  But I will have to leave the milk and go.  I drink milk every day.  But I don't drink it normally.  I drink milk every day.  But I won't get a chance to eat it normally every day.  Yes. Let me go and check.  Toony is not here.  But I can hear the kids.  That means she has left.  This is the right chance.  I will go and get rid of each and every rat.  Oh no! She has come back.  Oh no!  I should have jumped saying hail Lord Ram.  I am late because I was trying to think of my teacher.  I have come back at the right time.  That evil cat was coming to eat my kids.  Hey Toony. How are you?  Greetings, Your Highness.  Evil cat.  Wow! The king is calling me.  Wow! That's great.  I am fine.  I bathe in milk day and night.  By the way, you have kids. Right, Toony?  Oh no! Your Highness, did you see my kids from there?  No. I just guessed.  I mean you must have had kids.  How many do you have?  As if she doesn't know. Only five kids.  Wow! That's great.  That means I will get to eat non-vegetarian food for five days.  By the way, why were you jumping so much a while ago?  I mean why did you exercise?  She saw me at the wrong time.  No. I am getting fat by drinking milk.  I am getting junk in my body.  That's why I was exercising and nothing else.  I am thinking of building some biceps.  I will look good.  Okay, Your Highness.  Now I have to feed my kids.  If you permit me.  Yes. Sure. Sure.  Okay, I am leaving. Let me rest for a while.  Why is Toony praising me so much?  Do whatever you want, Toony.  I will feed your kids.  That too very soon.  He left.  Now I will feed you, kids. I will feed you.  What do I do now?  How do I save my kids from this cat?  I will have to get out of the nest.  Otherwise what will they eat?  But this cat.  This cat keeps an eye on us all the time.  It saw me leaving today.  And it was time to hunt.  I am glad I came back at the right time.  Otherwise I don't know what would have happened to my kids.  I think I will have to catch that cat even more.  That will be better.  No. No.  It is not difficult for Toony to feed her kids.  Even if Toony goes out, she won't go too far.  And she will keep an eye on her nest.  Why don't I cut this eggplant tree?  There will be no sound.  Wow.  But how do I cut this tree?  I will have to think after drinking some milk.  Eat. Eat a lot.  Your grandma is dying to feed me.  This cat has made a mess.  Mess?  This is nothing.  Now I will make her spill the milk too.  Look. Look.  I give her milk to drink every day.  And she spilled a bowl full of milk today.  A full bowl of milk.  I am not done yet.  It broke. It broke.  She broke the water pot too.  She broke the water pot too.  I don't know what this cat wants.  I don't know what is happening inside the house.  Why is there so much noise all of a sudden?  Now watch the real fun.  Wait. Wait.  I will teach you a lesson today.  Wait.  Look. The master is angry.  This is what I wanted.  Wait. Wait.  Touch me once.  After that I will beat you so badly..  ..that you will remember it for seven lifetimes.  First catch this don.  Then explain it to me.  What is the matter?  Why is the master after the cat?  With a stick in his hand.  It is not difficult to catch the don.  It is impossible.  You are instigating me.  Wait. Wait, cat.  I will catch you right now.  I got you.  Jump.  I got it out of my hand.  I couldn't catch it.  You scoundrel.  Just catch me once.  I will take out all the milk that you have given me.  It is not that easy.  I have raised you for so many days.  I made a big mistake.  You didn't even touch me once.  You kept drinking milk the whole day.  And you kept snoring and sleeping.  Catch me once.  Useless cat.  I got it. I got it. I got it.  It came out again.  It came out of my hand again.  You will hit me with milk.  Go and drink milk yourself.  I can't run anymore.  I am very tired.  Looks like the old man is tired.  He won't run anymore.  Now it will be fun.  Now I will sneak under the eggplant tree.  Why did this cat come under my nest?  I am sure he is up to something.  I don't understand.  There. There he is.  He is hiding under the eggplant tree.  I will throw the stick from here and hit him.  I am sure he will get hurt.  Wow, Mugambo. Wow.  You picked up the stick.  Now throw the stick.  And aim at me.  I will move away.  But this poor eggplant tree is done for.  And Mittuni's children will fall from the sky.  And I will eat them.  It looks like the old man will throw the stick and hit.  But if the stick doesn't hit the cat..  ..then it will hit the eggplant tree.  Then the nest and the children will fall.  I can't find the cat.  This is the chance. This is the chance.  Wow. Everything is going according to my plan.  But what do I do now?  The cat will move away.  And the stick will fall on the tree.  I don't understand what I should do.  No. No. No.  I got scared when I heard the bird's cry.  And I couldn't throw the stick properly and hit him.  It is very difficult for his children to eat..  ..as long as this Dhooni is there.  I am saved.  Wait. Wait, devil cat.  Come home once.  Then I will give you milk and water.  You are right. Just give me milk.  Today I will eat five small children.  I can't wait anymore.  How? How do I eat these cute children?  I am saved this time.  But for how many days will you go?  I won't take it.  Children, it has been many days since you opened your eyes.  So will you learn to fly now?  Yes. Yes. Just saying yes won't do.  You will have to give a test.  Are you ready? Yes. Great.  Then show me how to fly.  And sit on that tall tree.  Wow! Very good.  Now my worries are over.  Let that cat come this time.  Here. The devil came as soon as I said the name of the devil.  All of you hide behind the leaves.  Okay, mother.  What is this? Dhooni is still sitting.  That's enough.  Today I will talk sweetly and teach his children a lesson.  Okay, mother.  Come on. Come on.  Come on. Come on.  I will talk sweetly and teach his children a lesson.  It has been many days since I ate non-veg.  He is coming under the tree.  Come on. Today I will teach him a lesson.  Tuntuni, how are you?  How are your children?  Why should I tell you how my children are?  Wretched cat. Devil.  Get out of here. Go away.  What? Such a small mouth and such a big mouth?  I will teach you a lesson right now.  What will you show me?  I have seen enough of your games.  Now I will teach you a lesson.  Is that so? How dare you?  Wait there. I am coming.  My flower-like body has been bitten by thorns.  Oh God!  Someone remove these thorns.  Otherwise all the milk will flow.  Remove my thorns. Oh God!  It is hurting a lot.  It was fun.  That is why I say that I am small and sweet too.  My name is small bird Tuntuni.  I eat and drink and have fun.  I don't have any other work.  I don't have any other work.\n",
